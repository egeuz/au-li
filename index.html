            Do you have questions? Au-Li has answers. She is lithiated gold
            microparticles for your localized inquiries. Please use the provided
            text input field. For your less-localized energy resource and
            environmental questions, you can start here.
          </p>
          <p>
            But please don’t ask about the past. Au-Li only exists in the N.O.W.
            – though she is free to speculate about likely and unlikely futures,
            should you be interested in inquiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Au-Li is material. She is a unit of force extracted from rock, she’s
            a minor green revolution locked in zombie formations. Please refrain
            from personal questions, there is no there, there. But here: clouds
            of lithium smoke, lithium fires, lithium explosions, in lithium
            mines, workers weak and shaking and wondering – any number of
            things, but starting with what year it is as they squeeze lithium
            blood from stone. They should come here for their localized answers.
          </p>
          <q
            >On examination, she was in moderate distress, dehydrated asking for
            water to drink. Her vital signs were fluctuating while
            cardiovascular and respiratory exams were unremarkable. A
            neurological exam revealed slurred speech, tremors, and rigidity in
            the extremities with decreased motor strength in the upper
            extremities and lower extremities. She was oriented to place and
            person but not to time.</q
