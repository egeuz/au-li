When the negative and positive terminals are connected through an external circuit such as your flashlight, the battery discharges by driving electrons from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, providing the energy to generate light. </p><p>The negative terminal has to act like a sponge, absorbing and storing as many positively charged lithium ions as possible. Graphite is most commonly used. The positive terminal is often made from lithium cobalt oxide. The electrolyte includes lithium salts such as lithium hexafluorophosphate.</p><p>What makes lithium special? It is the lightest of all metals and the third-lightest element, sitting in the periodic table immediately after hydrogen and helium. Further, lithium has the highest ‘working voltage’ – the voltage difference between the negative terminal and the positive terminal.</p><p>On the one hand, this combination of a high working voltage and light weight make lithium-ion (Li-ion) betteries ideal for mobile applications. Thanks to Li-ion batteries, a Tesla car can get away with a battery weight of 600 kg, compared with 4,000 kg or more if it were to rely on conventional lead acid batteries.</p><p>On the other hand, atop a long-dormant volcano in northern Nevada, workers are preparing to start blasting and digging out a giant pit that will serve as the first new large-scale lithium mine in the United States in more than a decade.</p><p>The project, known as Lithium Americas, has drawn protests from members of Native American tribes, ranchers and environmental groups because it is expected to use billions of gallons of precious ground water, contaminating it for 300 years, while leaving behind a giant mound of waste.</p><p>“Blowing up a mountain isn’t green, no matter how much marketing spin people put on it,” said Max Wilbert.</p>"
